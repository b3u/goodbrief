    <h2>About /Brief</h2>
    <p>I went to an art and design school. I learned that if there is one thing that makes or 
        breaks a designer, it is having a good body of work. As a design student, I was always 
        looking to add to my portfolio. But without experience, it is difficult to get professional work.</p>
    <p>That’s why I made <strong>Brief</strong>. It generates random design briefs—the document with 
        all the specifications for the design that a hypothetical client would give you. You can choose 
        from many different types of design work and industries so that you always have fresh briefs 
        to practice on.</p>
    <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
    <p>I made the initial version in 2016 and I was surprised at how well it was received! It's been used all around 
        the world, and I love getting emails from people telling me how they've found the site useful. I know
        it's even been used in some schools to teach design, and featured on websites like 
        <a href="http://www.ucreative.com/articles/designer-creates-website-for-randomly-generated-design-briefs/">
        UCreative.</a> I love the designs I've seen people make based on my sites brief, and in 2018 I decided
        to redesign the website from the ground up. The original version is still available <a>here</a>, if 
        anyone prefers it.</p>
    <h3>Version 2.0</h3>
    <p>While the original site was just built with client-side Javascript and jQuery, I decided to use Node.js 
        and Express.js for the redesign. This will allow me to—among other things—lay the foundation for other features
        that I have planned down the road. For now, this update adds several new job types and industries, as well as
        a better sentence generation system and a refreshed design. If you have any suggestions for future updates, feel
